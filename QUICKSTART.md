# Quick Start Guide

Get your OCR Document Search system up and running in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- At least 4GB of free RAM
- 10GB of free disk space

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

```bash
cd ocr-document-search
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` if needed (defaults work for local development).

### 3. Make Setup Script Executable (Linux/Mac)

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

### 4. Run Setup Script

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 5. Wait for Services to Start

The services take about 30 seconds to start. Check status:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

All services should show "Up" status.

### 6. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

**http://localhost:3000**

## First Steps

### Upload Your First Document

1. Click on "Upload" in the navigation
2. Select a PDF or image file
3. Choose the document language (default: English)
4. Select preprocessing options (default: Document)
5. Click "Upload & Process"
6. Watch real-time progress updates!

### Search Documents

1. Wait for OCR processing to complete
2. Click on "Search" in the navigation
3. Enter search terms
4. View results with highlighted text
5. Click on a result to see full document pages

## Common Commands

### View Logs

```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f worker
```

### Restart Services

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Stop Services

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Rebuild After Code Changes

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

### Check Service Health

```bash
# Backend health check
curl http://localhost:4000/health

# Check MongoDB
docker-compose exec mongo mongosh --eval "db.runCommand({ connectionStatus: 1 })"

# Check Redis
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli ping
```

## Troubleshooting

### Services Won't Start

1. Check if ports are already in use:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000  # Frontend
   lsof -i :4000  # Backend
   lsof -i :27017 # MongoDB
   lsof -i :6379  # Redis
   ```

2. Check Docker logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs
   ```

### OCR Not Processing

1. Verify worker is running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps worker
   ```

2. Check worker logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f worker
   ```

3. Verify Redis connection:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec redis redis-cli ping
   ```

### Upload Fails

1. Check backend logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f backend
   ```

2. Verify upload directory exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la data/uploads
   ```

3. Check file size (max 100MB by default)

### Search Returns No Results

1. Verify document OCR is complete:
   - Check document status in upload logs
   - Status should be "done"

2. Wait a few seconds for MongoDB index to update

3. Try broader search terms

## Test Data

Upload these types of documents to test:

- **PDF documents**: Multi-page reports, papers
- **Scanned images**: Photos of documents, receipts
- **Screenshots**: Text from screenshots
- **Mixed quality**: Test different preprocessing options

## Next Steps

- Read the full [README.md](README.md) for detailed documentation
- Explore API endpoints at http://localhost:4000/api
- Try different languages and preprocessing options
- Set up authentication for production use

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
2. Verify all services are running: `docker-compose ps`
3. Review the troubleshooting section above
4. Check [README.md](README.md) for detailed documentation

## Production Deployment

For production use:

1. Change JWT_SECRET in `.env`
2. Use proper MongoDB authentication
3. Set up HTTPS/SSL
4. Configure proper backup strategy
5. Monitor resource usage
6. Set up logging and alerting

See [README.md](README.md) for production deployment details.
